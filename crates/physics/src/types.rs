//! # Physics Data Types
//!
//! This module defines the core data structures used throughout the JAXS physics
//! engine. These types are designed to be efficient and compatible with the
//! GPU-accelerated simulation loop.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The data structures in this module can be categorized as follows:
//!
//! -   **Geometric Primitives:** These are the basic building blocks for rigid
//!     bodies, such as [`Vec3`] for positions and velocities.
//! -   **Rigid Bodies:** These represent the dynamic objects in the simulation,
//!     including [`Sphere`], [`BoxBody`], and [`Cylinder`].
//! -   **Constraints:** These are used to connect rigid bodies, such as the
//!     [`Joint`] struct.
//! -   **Simulation Parameters:** These control the global behavior of the
//!     physics simulation, such as [`PhysParams`] and [`JointParams`].
//!
//! ## GPU Compatibility
//!
//! Many of the data structures in this module are marked with `#[repr(C)]` and
//! derive the [`bytemuck::Pod`] and [`bytemuck::Zeroable`] traits. This ensures
//! that their memory layout is compatible with the GPU, allowing them to be
//! transferred to and from the GPU without any conversion. This is a key
//! feature of the JAXS physics engine, as it enables the use of GPU
//! acceleration for the simulation loop.
