# JAXS Project Status Report

## Project Overview

JAXS (Just Another Exploration Substrate) is a Rust-based differentiable physics and machine learning framework designed for artificial life research. It combines:
- GPU-accelerated physics simulation using WebGPU
- Machine learning infrastructure for reinforcement learning
- Differentiable computing for end-to-end optimization
- Cross-platform support via WebGPU (Vulkan, Metal, DirectX)

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Physics Foundation

#### Task 1A: Joint System ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Type definitions for all joint types (Revolute, Prismatic, Ball, Fixed)
- ✅ API methods added to PhysicsSim
- ✅ Compute kernel registrations
- ✅ WGSL shader files created
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Shader implementations are empty placeholders
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No GPU integration in step_gpu()
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No CPU reference implementations

#### Task 1B: Collision Detection Matrix ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Kernel files created for sphere-cylinder, cylinder-cylinder, box-cylinder
- ✅ Kernels registered in enum
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: All collision shaders are empty placeholders
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No physics integration
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No CPU implementations

#### Task 1C: Advanced Physics Features ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- No continuous collision detection
- No advanced integration methods
- No enhanced material properties

### Phase 2: ML Infrastructure Enhancement

#### Task 2A: GPU Tensor Operations ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Only basic CPU tensor operations exist
- No GPU acceleration for ML operations
- Missing: Conv2D, BatchNorm, LSTM, GELU, pooling operations

#### Task 2B: Dreamer V3 World Model ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- No world model components
- No RSSM implementation
- No encoder/decoder networks

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. Duplicate Code Structure
- `/jaxs/` directory duplicates `/crates/runtime/` functionality
- Should be removed to avoid confusion

### 2. Empty/Placeholder Files
- `/benches/empty.rs` - Dummy benchmark (✅ REMOVED)
- Multiple joint solver implementations are placeholders

### 3. TODO Comments
- `physics/src/simulation.rs:510` - Contact information collection
- `physics/src/simulation.rs:978` - Cylinder mass calculation
- `physics/src/simulation.rs:1245` - Box mass calculation

## Recent Refactoring (Completed)

### Modularization of `jaxs/src/app.rs`
- Extracted constants for simulation parameters
- Split monolithic `run()` function into focused sub-functions:
  - `initialize_logging()` - Logging setup
  - `initialize_shader_watcher()` - Shader hot-reload setup
  - `create_test_scene()` - Scene initialization
  - `configure_world_physics()` - Physics parameters
  - `add_static_environment()` - Static objects
  - `add_test_objects()` - Dynamic test objects
  - `run_with_rendering()` - Windowed mode execution
  - `run_headless()` - Non-visual execution
- Added descriptive comments for each major section

### Improved `jaxs/src/watcher.rs`
- Introduced configuration constants
- Created `ShaderChangeHandler` struct for better organization
- Split file watching logic into smaller functions:
  - `create_file_watcher()` - Watcher creation
  - `start_watching_shaders()` - Directory monitoring setup
  - `handle_file_event()` - Event processing
  - `process_file_event()` - Event filtering
- Added better error handling and logging

### Enhanced `jaxs/src/main.rs`
- Introduced `ExecutionMode` enum for clarity
- Created `determine_execution_mode()` helper function
- Improved documentation and code organization

### Test Fixes
- Fixed compilation errors in physics tests
- Updated `add_plane()` calls to include required `Vec2` extents parameter
- All tests now pass consistently

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 days)
1. Remove duplicate `/jaxs/` directory
2. Address TODO comments in physics simulation
3. Decide whether to implement or remove placeholder joint solvers

### High Priority (1-2 weeks each)
1. **Joint System Implementation**
   - Implement WGSL shaders for constraint solving
   - Add CPU reference implementations
   - Integrate into physics pipeline
   - Estimated iterations: 15-20

2. **Collision Detection Completion**
   - Implement missing collision algorithms
   - Add proper contact generation
   - Test comprehensively
   - Estimated iterations: 10-15

### Medium Priority (3-4 weeks)
3. **GPU Tensor Operations**
   - Design GPU memory layout
   - Implement core ML operations
   - Add autodiff support
   - Estimated iterations: 20-25

### Long Term (1-2 months)
4. **Dreamer V3 Implementation**
   - Requires GPU tensor ops first
   - Complex architecture
   - Estimated iterations: 30+

## Development Guidelines

### When implementing features:
1. Always check existing code patterns first
2. Write CPU reference implementation before GPU
3. Add comprehensive tests for both CPU and GPU paths
4. Update documentation as you go

### Testing commands:
- Run tests: `cargo test`
- Run specific crate tests: `cargo test -p physics`
- Run with GPU: `cargo test --features gpu`

### Code style:
- Follow existing Rust conventions
- Keep compute kernels simple and focused
- Document physics algorithms with references

## Next Steps

The project has good architectural foundations but needs actual implementation of core features. Focus should be on completing the physics engine (joints and collisions) before moving to ML features, as they form the foundation for everything else.
